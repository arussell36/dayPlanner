Improvement Patches
- clear events button will clear the text boxes area
- current hour row will have a small amount of padding to make it more apparent
- the save button will not be in a wrapper div
	- the start state for save button will be separated and an unlocked icon when clicked it becomes locked icon and joins the 
	div so there is no padding separation. this will make it easier to see which events have been saved
	- start state will check local storage and if there is data start state save buttons will begin as locked
- styling on the boxes
- set interval to actively update page on the regular
